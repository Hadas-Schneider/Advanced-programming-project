#  - Advanced Programming Project | Online Furniture Store üõãÔ∏è
-This Project was submitted by Rawad Safiya, Hadas Scheider , Tom Pashinsky and Dana Pugach-

Welcome to our Online Furniture Store, a Python-based application that simulates a fully functional e-commerce platform. The application includes inventory management, user profiles, a shopping cart, a checkout process, and order management, all implemented using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

<br> <br>

## üìú Project Overview <br>
This project aims to:

Simulate an e-commerce application for managing and selling furniture.
Demonstrate the use of Python's OOP features, design patterns, and clean coding principles.
Optimize data structures for efficient inventory and user management.
The application is divided into the following components:
<br>
- Furniture Management <br>
- Inventory System <br>
- User Management <br>
- Shopping Cart <br>
- Order Management<br>
- API Integration <br>


------------------




## üõ†Ô∏è Features Implemented

### 1. Furniture Management
Base Class: Furniture

Attributes: u_id, name, description, material, color, wp, price, dimensions, country, available_quantity.<br>
Abstract method: calculate_discount (overridden in derived classes).<br>

- **Derived Classes:** <br>
        Chair, Table, Sofa, Bed, Wardrobe. <br>
        Each class has unique attributes and a custom implementation of calculate_discount.
        Example: Chairs with armrests receive an additional discount.<br>

- **Data Structure Choice:** <br>
        Used inheritance to ensure reusability and modularity, allowing for easy extension of new furniture types.
        Implemented @abstractmethod to enforce type-specific discount calculations.

---------

### 2. Inventory System

**Class: Inventory**

Stores all furniture items grouped by type in a dictionary (items_by_type dictionary of dictionaries). <br>
Supports efficient lookups, updates, and search functionality. <br>

- **Key Methods:** <br>
        add_item: Adds items to the inventory, grouped by their type.<br>
        remove_item: Removes items based on their name and type.<br>
        search_by_type: Retrieves all items of a specific type.<br>
        check_low_stock: Alerts when stock levels fall below a defined threshold.<br>

- **Data Structure Choice:** <br>
        Nested Dictionary:  Format : {type: {name: Furniture}}. <br>
                - Outer dictionary: Keys represent furniture types (e.g., "Chair"). <br>
                - Inner dictionary: Maps item names to Furniture objects.<br>
        Reasoning: Facilitates efficient type-based and name-based lookups (O(1) for each level).<br>

----------


### 3. User Management

**Class: User** <br>

Attributes: name, email, password (hashed), address, wishlist, order_history. <br>

- **Key Methods:**<br>
        register_user and login_user: Handle user registration and authentication.<br>
        add_to_wishlist: Allows users to save items for future purchases.<br>
        view_order_history: Displays all orders placed by the user.<br>

- **Data Structure Choice:** <br>
        - List for Order History:<br>
                - The User class uses a list to store a user's order history. <br>
                - This choice ensures: <br>
                        - Ordered Data: Orders are naturally stored in chronological order.<br>
                        - Ease of Retrieval: Simple iteration for displaying all past orders.<br>
                        - Flexibility: Supports appending new orders seamlessly.<br>


- **Possible Enhancements:**<br>
        - Wishlist: Tracks items users are interested in, stored as a list in the User class for simplicity.<br>

--------

### 4. Shopping Cart

**Class: ShoppingCart**

Attributes: user, cart_items.

- **Key Methods:**<br>
        add_item and remove_item: Manage items in the cart. <br>
        calculate_total: Computes the total price before discounts.<br>
        apply_discount: Applies type-specific discounts and cart-wide promotional discounts.<br>
        checkout: Validates items, processes payment (mocked), and finalizes the order.<br>
  
- **Data Structure Choice:** <br>
        - Dictionary for Cart Items:<br>
                - Keys: Furniture objects.<br>
                - Values: Quantities of each item.<br>
        - Reasoning: Supports efficient updates and lookups for items in the cart.<br>

- During the checkout process, the items in the cart are: <br>
        - Validated: Ensure that the requested quantities are available in the inventory. <br>
        - Passed to the Order: These items are directly passed to the Order object.<br>



-----------


### 5. Order Management

**Class: Order**

Attributes: order_id, user, items (the dictionary of ordered items) , total_price, status.


- **Key Features:** <br>
        - Automatically generates a unique order ID using uuid.<br>
        - Stores items purchased and their quantities.<br>
        - Tracks the order status (e.g., "Pending", "Completed").<br>

        
- **Data Structure Choice:**<br>
        - Order History: Stored as a list in the User class, enabling easy retrieval and iteration.<br>

## üß† Design Choices and Optimizations - Summary 

#### Object-Oriented Design:

Leveraged inheritance and polymorphism for reusable and modular code.<br>
Abstract base class (Furniture) enforces consistent discount logic.<br>



#### Data Structures:<br>

Nested dictionaries in Inventory for efficient grouping and retrieval.<br>
Dictionaries in ShoppingCart and UserManager for quick lookups.<br>
Lists for order history and wishlists for simplicity.<br>


#### Efficiency: <br>

Avoided redundant iterations by grouping items by type.<br>
Used lazy evaluations (e.g., filtering only when needed).<br>


#### Security:

Stored hashed passwords for users using hashlib.<br>
